After modifying, click Tools - Reload Pseudo Assets to reload. For example, for `common02/prefabs/art/dlc02_beach/plank`, you can change `pseudoPrefabSO` to `common02/pseudo_prefab_so/art/dlc02_beach/plank*` and change `materialSO` to `common02/pseudo_prefab_so/art/dlc02_beach/mat_dlc2_planks_*`.
  - Some prefabs has a `PseudoPrefabSOArray` component. For environment objects with this component, you can change the material in `PseudoPrefabSOArray > pseudoPrefabSOs`. After modifying, click Tools - Reload Pseudo Assets to reload.



### Camera

- <span id="MultiplayerCamera">`MultiplayerCamera`</span> - Camera follow component
  - `m_gradientLimit` - Maximum movement speed while following. Defaults to 4.

  - `m_{x}EdgeBuffer` - The ratio of the screen size reserved as padding between the x-most player and the screen edge. Defaults to 0.4.
  - `m_minDistance` - The minimum distance between the camera and the player plane. When players cluster in the center, the camera distance decreases.
  - `m_maxDistance` - The maximum distance between the camera and the player plane. When players are spread out, the camera distance increases.
  - `m_maxUDistance` - The maximum distance the camera can move forward or backward. When players move in the same direction, the camera will follow in that direction.
  - `m_maxRDistance` - The maximum distance the camera can move left or right. When players move in the same direction, the camera will follow in that direction.



### Trigger Components

- `TriggerTimer` - Timer trigger

  - `m_startTrigger` - The trigger that starts this timer.
  - `m_completeTrigger` - The trigger sent when this timer ends (target is itself).
  - `m_time` - Timer duration in seconds.
  - `m_startTiming` - Whether to start the timer immediately at the start of the level.
  - `m_triggerAtStart` - Whether to send the trigger once immediately at the start of the level.

- `TriggerQueue` - Looping queue trigger

  - `m_startTrigger` - The trigger that starts this looping queue.
  - `m_cancelTrigger` - The trigger that cancels this looping queue.
  - `m_endTrigger` - The trigger sent when a queue loop ends.
  - `m_endTriggerTarget` - The target to which the end trigger is sent.
  - `m_startOnAwake` - Whether to start the queue immediately at the start of the level.
  - `m_loopWhenFinished` - Whether to loop.
  - `m_loopDelay` - The interval in seconds between two queue loops.
  - `m_targetType` - The target type to which the queue triggers are sent.
  - `m_animator` - The target Animator (when `m_targetType` is `Animator`).
  - `m_targetObject` - The target GameObject (when `m_targetType` is `Object`).
  - `m_finishedTrigger` - The trigger sent when the Animation ends (when `m_targetType` is `Animator` and `m_waitForFinished` is `true`); defaults to `"AnimationFinished"`.
  - `m_waitForFinished` - Whether to wait for the Animation to finish before starting the next item in the queue (when `m_targetType` is `Animator`).
  - `m_queue` - `triggers` and `delays` should be of equal length, representing the triggers sent and the timer durations in seconds for each item in the queue.

  > - To use `m_waitForFinished`, add the Animator and `TriggerQueue` to the same object, and add a `SendTriggerToObject` behaviour to the animation's State. Set the `triggerToSend` field to `"AnimationFinished"` and check the `orTriggerOnExit` checkbox. __Note: When adding the behaviour, you may see multiple behaviours with the same name. Add the behaviour from the project code (the Script icon is C#); do not add the behaviour from the bundle (the Script icon is a blank document icon).__
  > - If looping is enabled, on the second loop, `m_queue.m_triggers[0]` is sent immediately after `m_loopDelay`; `m_queue.m_delays[0]` is no longer timed.
